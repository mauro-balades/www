        There was a time when the internet felt different—when it wasn’t a maze
        of dark patterns designed to manipulate your attention, when software
        was built for the user, not for the highest bidder. Back then, a browser
        was simply a tool, a window to the world, not a marketplace disguised as
        an app.<br /><br /><strong
          >Somewhere along the way, that changed.</strong
        ><br /><br />Today, browsers are riddled with engagement traps. They
        track you, sell your data, shove crypto schemes in your face, and call
        it ‘innovation.’ But real innovation isn’t about bloated AI assistants
        or endless monetization tricks. Real innovation makes life simpler, not
        more exhausting.
      </div>
      <div>
        I built Zen because I believe the browser should serve you. It should be
        fast, transparent, and private by design—not as a checkbox feature, but
        as a philosophy. It should get out of your way, so you can get in, do
        what you need to do, and step away from the screen without feeling
        drained.<br /><br />I’m not a corporation. I don’t have a marketing team
        crafting sleek slogans, nor a boardroom plotting engagement metrics. I’m
        just a developer who saw what was wrong and decided to fix it. Zen isn’t
        about gimmicks. It’s about respect—for your time, your privacy, and your
        right to a better web.<br /><br />It won’t be perfect, and I won’t
        pretend to have all the answers. But with the help of a passionate
        community, I know we can build something that matters. A browser that
        doesn’t fight against you, but works with you.<br /><br /><br />
        <h1>There was a browser that kind of did this—Arc.</h1>
        <br />For a while, it felt like a breath of fresh air: a browser that
        challenged conventions, that cared about design, that aimed to make
        browsing feel intentional rather than chaotic. It rethought the
        interface, introduced thoughtful features, and for a moment, it seemed
        like someone finally got it.<br /><br /><strong
          >But then, things changed.</strong
        ><br /><br />Arc was discontinued for Mac, leaving its early adopters
        stranded. The Windows version, when it finally arrived, was a shadow of
        what was promised—slow, unstable, missing core features. What started as
        a vision for a better browser quickly became yet another company chasing
        after monetization, pivoting to AI gimmicks and engagement loops instead
        of refining the core experience.
      </div>
      <div>
        I won’t pretend Arc didn’t inspire me. It did. There’s a lot to admire
        in its design philosophy, in its willingness to rethink how we interact
        with the web. But inspiration isn’t imitation. I’m taking the
        good—thoughtful UX, a clean interface, a focus on user control—and
        cutting out the bad. No forced online accounts. No feature bloat
        disguised as innovation. No chasing trends just to stay relevant.<br /><br />Zen
        isn’t about maximizing engagement. It’s about minimizing friction. It’s
        about building a browser that works with you, not on you. And beyond
        that, I’m exploring my own ideas—rethinking not just how a browser
        looks, but how it feels to use. How it fits into your life without
        demanding more of your attention than necessary.
