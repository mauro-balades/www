      <div>
        There was a time when the internet felt different‚Äîwhen it wasn‚Äôt a maze
        of dark patterns designed to manipulate your attention, when software
        was built for the user, not for the highest bidder. Back then, a browser
        was simply a tool, a window to the world, not a marketplace disguised as
        an app.<br /><br /><strong
          >Somewhere along the way, that changed.</strong
        ><br /><br />Today, browsers are riddled with engagement traps. They
        track you, sell your data, shove crypto schemes in your face, and call
        it <i>‚Äòinnovation.‚Äô</i> But real innovation isn‚Äôt about bloated AI assistants
        or endless monetization tricks. Real innovation makes life <u>simpler</u>, not
        more exhausting.
      </div>
      <div>
        I built Zen because I believe the browser should serve you. It should be
        fast, transparent, and private by design‚Äînot as a checkbox feature, but
        as a philosophy. It should get out of your way, so you can get in, do
        what you need to do, and step away from the screen without feeling
        drained.<br /><br />I‚Äôm not a corporation. I don‚Äôt have a marketing team
        crafting sleek slogans, nor a boardroom plotting engagement metrics. I‚Äôm
        just a developer who saw what was wrong and decided to fix it. Zen isn‚Äôt
        about gimmicks. It‚Äôs about respect‚Äîfor your time, your privacy, and your
        right to a better web.<br /><br />It won‚Äôt be perfect, and I won‚Äôt
        pretend to have all the answers. But with the help of a passionate
        community, I know we can build something that matters. A browser that
        doesn‚Äôt fight against you, but works <u>with you</u>.<br /><br /><br />
        <h1>There was a browser that kind of did this ‚Äî Arc.</h1>
        <br />For a while, it felt like a breath of fresh air: a browser that
        challenged conventions, that cared about design, that aimed to make
        browsing feel intentional rather than chaotic. It rethought the
        interface, introduced thoughtful features, and for a moment, it seemed
        like someone finally got it.<br /><br /><strong
          >But then, things changed.</strong
        ><br /><br />The Browser Company, Arc's VC-backed creators, became ambitious, and they decided that their loyal user-base still fell short of their goals to compete with the big names like Chrome, right from the start. Thus, they announced that Arc was "good enough" and went off to work on a new AI-powered browser.<br/><br/><i>Yet, it wasn't.</i> The Windows version was a shadow of what was promised‚Äîslow, unstable, missing core features. The MacOS version was in a better state, but performance and stability gradually degraded with every update. What started as a vision for a better browser quickly became yet another company chasing after monetization, pivoting to AI gimmicks and engagement loops instead of refining the core experience. Thus, Arc was finished, before it had even reached its real potential.
      </div>
      <div>
        I won‚Äôt pretend Arc didn‚Äôt inspire me. It did. There‚Äôs a lot to admire
        in its design philosophy, in its willingness to rethink how we interact
        with the web. But inspiration isn‚Äôt imitation. I‚Äôm taking the
        good‚Äîthoughtful UX, a clean interface, a focus on user control‚Äîand
        cutting out the bad. No forced online accounts. No feature bloat
        disguised as innovation. No chasing trends just to stay relevant.<br /><br />Zen
        isn‚Äôt about maximizing engagement. It‚Äôs about minimizing friction. It‚Äôs
        about building a browser that works with you, not on you. And beyond
        that, I‚Äôm exploring my own ideas‚Äîrethinking not just how a browser
        looks, but how it feels to use. How it fits into your life without
        demanding more of your attention than necessary. While it's still in
        early development, I'm excited to share it with you, and to hear your
        thoughts on how we can make it better together.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>So, what's the plan?</h1>
        <br />Zen is still in its early stages, but it‚Äôs growing fast. I‚Äôm
        working on a roadmap that focuses on the essentials: mantain firefox updated
        and secure to gain trust, improve the UI/UX to make it more intuitive and enjoyable, and
        implement features that make your life easier, not more complicated.

        The future of Zen isn‚Äôt set in stone. It‚Äôs a work in progress, shaped by
        your feedback, your ideas, and your needs. I‚Äôm not building this browser
        for me. I‚Äôm building it for you‚Äîfor all of us who believe the web can be
        better, who want to take back control of our digital lives, and who
        refuse to settle for the status quo.<br /><br />If you‚Äôre tired of
        browsers that treat you like a product, if you‚Äôre looking for a
        different way to browse, if you believe in a web that respects your
        privacy and your time, then I invite you to join me on this journey. Let‚Äôs
        build something that matters. Let‚Äôs build a browser that respects you.
        <br />
        <br />
        I also want to invite you to contribute, if you have any ideas, suggestions
        or want to help in any way, feel free to let us know. Some zen features where completely
        community driven, implemented by external contributors. We are always looking for
        new ideas and ways to improve the browser.
